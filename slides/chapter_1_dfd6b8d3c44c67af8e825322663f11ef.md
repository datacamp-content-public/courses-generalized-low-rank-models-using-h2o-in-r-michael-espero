`@script`
In the last set of exercises you trained a GLRM for the purpose of predicting missing values in a mixed data set. Now let's reconstruct the imperfect training data set by imputing missing values of arbitrary variable type. To finish lesson 2, you will use a heatmap to display the effectiveness of this approach.

## The Missing Data Problem

## "Borrow strength from what was observed."

Recall that generalized low rank models "borrow strength" from what was observed to predict what wasn't.

## Compress what was observed into 2 matrices.

`@script`
We accomplished this by compressing observed dataset "A" with rows "m" and columns "n" into a long "X" matrix and a wide "Y matrix". As you can see, the width of the X matrix is "k" columns wide and the height of the Y matrix is "k rows long"

Now we're going to use the last GLRM we made to impute missing data.

## Recall the model trained for imputation.

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: cd8c763b88
```

`@part1`
```
finance_glrm_impute <- h2o.glrm(
	training_frame = finance_train, 
	validation_frame = finance_test,
    k = 10
)
```

`@script`


`@citations`
Here's the code you used to build a GLRM with rank 10 for imputation of missing values in a finance data set.

## Use your GLRM to impute missing values

```yaml
type: TwoRows
key: 2268b98219
```

`@part1`
```
b_corp_glrm <- h2o.glrm(training_frame = train,
                        k = 64,
                        seed = 143)
```

`@part2`
```
reconstructed_frame <- h2o.reconstruct(
			b_corp_glrm,
            train)
```

`@script`


`@citations`
Now we're going to use h2o's reconstruct keyword, applying the GLRM imputation model to impute missing values. The result should be a new version of the original, imperfect training data- this time free from missing values.

## Visualize missing values in mixed data.

```yaml
type: FullSlide
key: 1687fc8f3b
```

`@part1`
```
library(DataExplorer)

plot_missing(reconstructed_frame)
```

`@script`
We can apply the plot_missing keyword from the DataExplorer package to display any missing values in the reconstructed training set.
