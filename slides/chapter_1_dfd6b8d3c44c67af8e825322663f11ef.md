`@script`
In the last set of exercises you trained a generalized low rank model for the purpose of predicting missing values in a mixed data set. Now let's reconstruct the imperfect training data by imputing missing values of arbitrary variable type. To finish lesson 2, you will display the effectiveness of this approach by comparing the number of missing values present in the imperfect data frame we started with to the GLRM reconstructed data. Soon you'll be ready to add GLRMs trained for the purpose of imputing mixed data to your own unique workflow with H2O.

`@script`
"Why do missing data create such difficulty in scientific research? Because most data analysis procedures were not designed for them." said Shafer and Graham in 2002. We've already discussed some of the drawbacks of common procedures like list-wise deletion. Biased inference is another concern with missing data. It's important to consider whether unobserved values can be assumed missing completely at random or were left out due to some mechanism related to other measured features or perhaps even other reasons we are yet to appreciate.

`@part2`
- Empirical studies in the domain of finance (N = 946) 
- **27% reported missing data** encompassing 0.1% to 81% of all observations.
- **Most used listwise deletion**, dropping all rows with a single missing value.

`@script`
In the best of cases, financial applications that drop observations with missing values are **inefficient**; In the worst of cases, this heuristic is **biasing inference**. Kofman and Sharpe used 946 publications specific to the domain of finance and showed that more than a quarter of quantitative analysts reported missing values in their work. Most of them used list-wise deletion.

`@part2`
- Economic Development
- Logistical Challenges
- Political Institutions
- Differential Disclosure

`@script`
A number of factors contribute to missing data in finance. Economic development may play a role as omission of certain information may be common in developing nations relative to wealthy, democratic countries. There may be a lack of resources to conduct uninterrupted measurement and updates with regards to the details of several financial variables. Logistical challenges may impede complete data collection where infrastructure is lacking or in duress due to political instability. Particularly sensitive financial information may be withheld or differentially disclosed across reporting agencies. As consequence, richer, more democratic bodies may be overrepresented in samples produced in workflows using list-wise deletion, for instance.

`@script`
Now let's load the "DataExplorer" package to access a convenient function that builds a lollipop chart showing proportions of missing values in these variables. We can use the pipe operator to first, convert an H2OFrame into a tibble data frame- and then, pass the tibble of imperfect data with missing values to the plot_missing function. Here you can see that a large proportion of missing data is present in the data at hand.

`@script`
In the words of the scientist Madeleine Udell, "generalized low rank models "borrow strength" from what WAS observed to predict what wasn't." Dr. Udell and data scientists at H2O have made applying GLRMs simple, allowing the analyst to focus on bringing their domain expertise to the tools. With generalized low rank models in H2O, you can will adapt model hyperparameters to represent your team's specific point of view for the data at hand.

`@script`
Recall that GLRMS work by compressing observed dataset "A" with rows "m" and columns "n" into a long "X" matrix and a wide "Y matrix". As you can see, the width of the X matrix is "k" columns wide and the height of the Y matrix is "k rows long". The width of the y matrix, n, is the width of all columns in "A", plus the added width of the embedded features or levels contained in all non-numeric columns

## Recognize the model trained for imputation.

```yaml

key: cd8c763b88
```

`@part1`
```
b_corp_glrm <- h2o.glrm(
			training_frame = train_w_missing,
            k = 64,
            seed = 143
)
```

`@script`
Here's the G-L-R-M you trained on imperfect data in the last exercise with rank 64 and seed 143 indicated for reproducibility. It's available in the environment as a H2O-Dim_Reduction-Model.

## Use your GLRM to impute missing values

```yaml
type: TwoRows
key: 2268b98219
```

`@part1`
```
b_corp_glrm <- h2o.glrm(
			training_frame = train,
            k = 64,
            seed = 143
)
```

`@part2`
```
glrm_imputed_data <- h2o.reconstruct(
			b_corp_glrm,
            train_w_missing)
```

`@script`
The next phase of mixed data imputation is to use h2o's reconstruct function, applying the GLRM designed for imputation to predict missing values with domain expertise informed loss-functions for each variable, or in this case, useful defaults. Here we pass our previously trained generalized low rank model as the first argument and our original imperfect training data as the second, assigning the reconstructed data to an H2OFrame called "glrm_imputed_data". The result should be a new version of the original, imperfect training data- this time free from missing values.

`@citations`
Now let's compare the number of missing values in each column of the original, imperfect training data with the G-L-R-M imputed data. By these counts, the G-L-R-M imputed data appears to be free from missing values in every column.

```

`@script`
We can apply the plot_missing function again to a tidyverse friendly version of our reconstructed H2OFrame and display proportions of missing values in the reconstructed training set.
